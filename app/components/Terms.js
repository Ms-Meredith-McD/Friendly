The only way to remove posts or accounts from this website is to report them to me and I will delete the accounts and their posts.  A future upgrade can include approval of people registering to use the site. For now, only people I tell about the site will know it exists and its just for fun! But, keep in mind, its not secure, so no secrets, just fun chat! </p>
